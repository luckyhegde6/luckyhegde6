# 👋 Hi, I'm Lucky Hegde

Full-stack engineer with strong foundations in **TypeScript, backend systems,
and modern web architecture**, actively growing into **senior-level ownership
and system design responsibilities**.

I build real systems end-to-end — frontend, backend, databases, auth,
infrastructure — and care deeply about **clarity, scalability, and trade-offs**.

## 🧩 System Design & Engineering Thinking

I actively practice:
- Designing scalable backend systems
- Explaining architectural trade-offs
- Writing readable, maintainable code
- Thinking in services, boundaries, and failure modes

My projects increasingly include **design-first thinking**, not just implementation.

- Distributed systems basics (queues, schedulers)
- Dynamic Programming & DSA for interviews
- Writing clear design docs and technical explanations
- Production-ready GenAI integration

---

## 🎯 Career Direction

- Preparing for **Senior Software Engineer** roles
- Building 2–3 deeply documented portfolio projects
- Demonstrating ownership, mentoring mindset, and system thinking
- Strong interviews across **React, Backend, System Design, and Leadership**
