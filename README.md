# I'm Lucky Hegde

Full-stack engineer focused on building **production-ready web systems** with
clear architecture, strong fundamentals, and scalable thinking.

I enjoy working across the stack — from React UIs to backend APIs, databases,
auth, and infrastructure — and I’m actively preparing for **senior-level roles**.

---

## 🧠 What I Focus On

- Full-stack development with **Next.js, TypeScript, React**
- Backend systems, APIs, auth, roles & permissions
- Databases (SQL, Prisma, MongoDB) and data modeling
- System design fundamentals (scalability, trade-offs)
- Cloud & infra (AWS, GCP, Docker, self-hosting)
- Writing code that is **readable, explainable, and evolvable**

## 🧩 System Design & Engineering Thinking

I actively practice:
- Designing scalable systems (URL shortener, task schedulers, dashboards)
- Explaining trade-offs (consistency vs availability, cost vs scale)
- Breaking problems into services and responsibilities
- Writing design docs before coding

This GitHub is evolving toward **clear system design signals**.

---

## 📚 Currently Learning

- Advanced React patterns & performance optimization
- Distributed systems basics (queues, schedulers)
- Dynamic Programming & DSA for interviews
- Writing better design docs & technical explanations

---

## 🎯 2025–2026 Goals

- Ship 2–3 **deep, well-documented portfolio projects**
- Be comfortable leading system design interviews
- Demonstrate senior-level ownership and decision-making
- Transition into a **Senior Software Engineer** role
